The Traditional office of Compline in HTML and GABC

This is still a work in progress, but you can see it in its current form [here](http://bbloomf.github.io/compline/).

I mostly just need to clean up the code, and make the calendar code more re-usable.

I also want to add an option of not showing all the options, and just trusting the decisions based on the date, as well as add an option for psalms to be notated in full rather than just pointed.

I need to add some regional calendars for saints that have different ranks in different regions or are only celebrated in certain regions.
