The Traditional office of Compline in HTML and GABC

Forked from [project by bbloomf](https://github.com/bbloomf/compline).  You can see what it looks
like in its current form [here](http://sethborders.github.io/compline/).

!TODO
-----

* Add tones for all prayers when in long form (some may have to be composed from the rubrics)
* make short and long forms be the same page (instead of maintaining separately)
* Consolidate seasonal selection to just one drop-down
* Eventually support autodetecting from date.
* Add english translations
* Triduum Compline is much different, recto tono
* Easter Octave has its own special antiphon and psalms
* All Souls day omits the normal introductions and has special psalms and no antiphon
* In manus tuas has different tones:
  * all times of year except Advent and Eastertide
  * In Passiontide, EXCEPT ON First or Second class FEASTS, Gloria Patri is omitted, and In Manus tuas is repeated immediately in its place
  * Advent: from Saturday before 1st sunday of Advent until December 23 inclusive
  * Easter: From Saturday before Low Sunday until the Friday in hte Octave of Pentecost inclusive
