The Traditional office of Compline in HTML and GABC

This is still a work in progress, but you can see it in its current form [here](http://bbloomf.github.io/compline/).

I mostly just need to clean up the code, and make the calendar code more re-usable.

I also want to add an option of not showing all the options, and just trusting the decisions based on the date.

I need to add some regional calendars for saints that have different ranks in different regions or are only celebrated in certain regions.
