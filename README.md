compline
========

The Traditional office of Compline in HTML and GABC

This is still a work in progress, but you can see it in its current form [here](http://bbloomf.github.io/compline/).

Right now (June 2016), I'm working on implementing compline for Easter Week, All Souls' Day, and Holy Thursday and Good Friday.

I will add a calendar of first and second class feasts as well, so that it will be able to figure everything out from just today's date, which will be shown at the top, as a date picker so that a different date could also be chosen.
