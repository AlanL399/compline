Laus tibi... should only be shown, when it is actually to be used
Same for "P.T..."

System for calendar:
  how about tag attributes include and exclude?
  i.e., <div exclude='11/02'> to exclude on november 2 and <div exclude='easter:easter+49'> to exclude from Easter through Pentecost Sunday
  , <div include='advent1-1:12/23'>
  special names needed for 'easter' and 'advent1', but 'septuagesima' and 'ashwednesday' might be nice
